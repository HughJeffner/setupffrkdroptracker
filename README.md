# This Repo Has Moved!
You can find it here:
https://github.com/HughJeffner/FFRK-Drop-Tracker-Setup

Please the new repostory instead, this one will be archived and set to read-only.  This change was required because I wanted to fork the original project (it didn't exist when I originally created this).  The only way was to fork a new repository and port all of the changes over to it.  This way, if the original author makes any updates I can quickly merge them in.

Thanks for understanding!
